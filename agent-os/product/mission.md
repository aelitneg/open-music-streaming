# Product Mission

## Pitch
Open Music Streaming is a decentralized music streaming platform that helps independent music creators and their supporters break free from centralized streaming monopolies by providing a transparent, interoperable ecosystem built on ATProtocol with detailed analytics for fair creator compensation.

## Users

### User Personas

## The Problem

### Centralized Music Streaming Monopoly
Current music streaming is dominated by a few centralized platforms that control discovery, distribution, and compensation. Independent artists receive minimal payouts (often less than $0.004 per stream) while platforms keep the majority of revenue. This creates an unfair system where creators cannot sustain themselves and fans have limited control over their music consumption experience.

**Our Solution:** A decentralized, interoperable music streaming ecosystem built on ATProtocol that provides transparent analytics, fair compensation models, and platform independence for both creators and consumers.

## Differentiators

### Decentralized Architecture
Unlike Spotify, Apple Music, or other centralized platforms, we provide a truly decentralized ecosystem where creators maintain ownership of their content and data. This results in fairer compensation, platform independence, and transparent analytics that benefit both creators and consumers.

### ATProtocol Integration
Unlike traditional streaming platforms, we leverage ATProtocol for interoperability between different components (catalogs, players, analytics). This results in an open ecosystem where third-party developers can build complementary tools and services.

### Granular Analytics & Fair Compensation
Unlike current platforms that provide minimal payout transparency, we track consumption down to the second and provide detailed analytics. This results in fair compensation based on actual listening behavior rather than opaque algorithms.
